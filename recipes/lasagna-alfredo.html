    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This chicken Alfredo lasagna with ricotta and spinach is so good that my family requests it at least once a week. Serve with diced tomato as a garnish.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="list">
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach</li>
        <li>3 cooked, boneless chicken breast halves, diced</li>
        <li>2 (16 ounce) jars Alfredo-style pasta sauce, divided</li>
        <li>2 pints ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>4 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol class="list">
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add lasagna noodles and cook until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes; drain.</li>
        <li>Place frozen spinach and 1/2 cup water in a 2-quart nonstick saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-high, cover, and cook, stirring occasionally, until spinach is tender, 6 to 7 minutes. Drain and squeeze out any excess water.</li>
        <li>Stir together chicken and 1 jar Alfredo sauce in a medium bowl until well combined.</li>
        <li>Mix together ricotta and spinach in a second medium bowl until well combined.</li>
        <li>Arrange a single layer of lasagna noodles in a 9x13-inch baking dish, edges overlapping. Pour chicken-Alfredo mixture over noodles and spread evenly. Sprinkle with 1 cup mozzarella. Cover with another layer of noodles. Spread spinach mixture evenly over noodles. Pour 1/2 of the remaining jar of Alfredo sauce over spinach mixture and spread evenly. Sprinkle with 1 cup mozzarella. Lay on a final noodle layer and top with remaining 1/2 jar Alfredo sauce and 2 cups mozzarella. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the top is brown and bubbly, 50 to 60 minutes.</li>
